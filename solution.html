      <h2>Air</h2>
	  <ol>
      <li>Increase in the use of scrubbers in factories</li>
		<ul>
		<li>We propose using more scrubbers, which remove pollutants from factories before they leave 
		the smokestacks, to reduce the levels of air pollution. </li>
		<li>This graph shows the necessity of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere in order to slow the rate of global warming. 
 </li>
 <li>Scrubbers remove 98% of sulfur from emitted gases. 
</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Clean Air Act</li>
		<ul>
		<li>We also suggest expanding the Clean Air Act, which gives factories incentives to limit their sulfur dioxide emissions below a certain level. These actions will take steps towards improving our air quality. 
 </li>
		</ul>

      <h2>Water</h2>
	  <ol>
      <li>Promoting pollution prevention (P2) practices through employee training</li>
		<ul>
		<li>We propose that at all factories, or at more factories, the employees receive training in terms of having the knowledge they need in order to minimize waste generation. Employees
		could learn more about spill/leak prevention methods. Ultimately, employees would know more about source reduction. According to the EPA website, “the opportunities for source reduction
		are not realized as existing regulations focus upon treatment and disposal.” </li>
		<li>Using less toxic chemicals in factories </li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Encourage factories to utilize the EPA’s Pollution Prevention resources</li>
	  <li>Regulating more chemicals found in water</li>
		<ul>
		<li>While the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified and regulates 94 chemicals that are commonly found in contaminated water, there are still many other chemicals
		that the EPA has not accounted for that could be potentially dangerous to animal, plant and/or human life.	We propose that we will reach out to the EPA in hopes of working with 
		them to identify these other potentially-harmful pollutants and begin to regulate them. </li>

      <h2>Energy</h2>
	  <ol>
      <li>Switching to renewable energies</li>
		<ul>
		<li>We propose that we use this opportunity to transition to renewable energy and begin shutting down coal power plants. If the industrial industry transitions to full reliance on green energy many other sectors are likely to follow, furthermore carbon emissions would drop a substantial amount, slowing global warming.
</li>
		<li>According to the EPA, switching to renewable energy sources will prevent the emission of greenhouse gases, limit air pollution, and create jobs.  
 </li>
