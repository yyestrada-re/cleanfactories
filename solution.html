        <p>
          In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed the impact of lockdown on environmental factors — 
          air quality has improved across the globe, industrial dumping has decreased and energy usage has declined. 
          This brief period of environmental headway is largely due to the slowdown of industrial production and 
          as lockdowns begin to ease, it has become increasingly apparent that we capitalize on this brief period of environmental 
          respite and work towards implementing a “green” recovery. But what exactly does that mean? Well, we have a few suggestions:

                    <li>
                      We propose that at all factories, or at more factories, the employees receive training in terms of having the knowledge they need in 
                      order to minimize waste generation. Employees could learn more about spill/leak prevention methods. Ultimately, employees would know 
                      more about source reduction. According to the EPA website, “the opportunities for source reduction are not realized as existing 
                      regulations focus upon treatment and disposal.”

                      are commonly found in contaminated water, there are still many other chemicals that the EPA has
                      not accounted for that could be potentially dangerous to animal, plant and/or human life. We
                      propose that we will reach out to the EPA in hopes of working with them to identify these 
                      other potentially-harmful pollutants and begin to regulate them.
