      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <h3>The use of factories poses many threats to our air, water, and energy sources and ultimately endangers our climate.</h3>
      <p>
        Over 50% of greenhouse gases can be attributed to industry and electrical generation, and factories may be responsible for 
        â…” of the pollution that has caused climate change. Burning fossil fuels releases toxic pollutants that can be harmful to human health, 
        and the illegal dumping of contaminated waste products into waterways damages marine ecosystems. Clearly, factories are a major problem, 
        but what can we do to fix them?
