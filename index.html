            can be attributed to industry and electrical generation, and factories may be responsible for

          </h3>
          <p>
            That is a problem. A <b>BIG</b> problem, with <b>BIG</b> implications. Not only do factories pose many threats to our air, water, and energy sources that ultimately degrade and endager our
            environment, but they also pose a myriad adverse health effects that have continously claimed the lives of innocent animals and human beings alike.

            Clearly, the lack of awareness and strict environmental regulations for factories
            is a major problem plaguing both society and surrounding ecosystems. So, what can <i>we</i> do to fix it?
