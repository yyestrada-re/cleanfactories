			Factories not only emit into the air, but they also release harmful chemicals into water as well. 
			Many of these chemicals are released into groundwater, which is used as drinking water by 115 million people ‚Äî more than ‚Öì of the US population. 
			According to an article released by the United States Geological Society (<a href = "https://www.usgs.gov/news/quality-nation%E2%80%99s-groundwater" target = "_blank">USGS</a>), 1 of every 5 groundwater samples from parts of aquifers used for

			pollutants and chemicals can cause negative health effects, such as lead, which can cause illness in animals and humans because lead inhibits the 
			action of bodily enzymes. Furthermore, their greenhouse gas emissions are a key factor in causing acid rain, which can have a detrimental effect on
			plant life as well as marine life.

				<h3>How Air Has Been Affected by COVID-19</h3>
				<p>Across the world, economic slowdowns have reduced the rate of industrial production, pausing the emission of greenhouse gases and resulting in cleaner air. Following the COVID-19
				outbreak in China, NASA‚Äôs Aura satellite and ESA‚Äôs Sentinel-5 satellite have observed a significant <a href = "https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146362/airborne-nitrogen-dioxide-plummets-over-china" target = "_blank">drop in nitrogen dioxide levels over China</a>. 
				Nitrogen dioxide is a gas produced by industrial production, automobiles, and power plants. It is also a precursor to ozone, which can be harmful to our lungs, so it is important to limit its emission. Similar declines in
				nitrogen dioxide levels have been observed <a href = "https://airquality.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target = "_blank">by NASA</a> across South America. Air pollution is the cause of many respiratory illnesses that may make some people in polluted cities more susceptible
				to the virus, meaning that air pollution may <a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/nasa-funds-four-research-projects-on-covid-19-impacts" target = "_blank">increase the severity</a> of COVID-19 outbreaks. COVID-19 has shown us how the world looks without air pollution and emphasized the importance of reducing it. </p>
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>We propose using more scrubbers, which remove pollutants from factories before they leave the smokestacks, to reduce the levels of air pollution. We also suggest expanding the Clean Air Act, 
				which gives factories incentives to limit their sulfur dioxide emissions below a certain level. These actions will take steps towards improving our air quality. </p>

				<h3>How Water Has Been Affected by COVID-19</h3>
				<p>With the decrease in emissions from factories, the amount of runoff from the emissions into the water have decreased and cleared the water. However, many people are now using disposable masks, gloves and hand 
				sanitizer daily to keep themselves and their loved ones protected. These finished plastic hand sanitizer bottles and used gloves and masks are being discarded onto the ground instead of into trash cans or recycling 
				bins. With the pandemic having impacted every state in the United States and the majority of the world, it is no surprise that all of this litter has led to the accumulation of waste in oceans. According to an 
				article published in The Guardian, if people do not stop throwing their one-time use masks, gloves, and empty hand sanitizer bottles onto the ground, 
				<a href = "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/08/more-masks-than-jellyfish-coronavirus-waste-ends-up-in-ocean" target = "_blank">there will eventually be more ‚ÄúCOVID waste,‚Äù in the oceans than
				there are jellyfish</a>.
				Furthermore, the problem of lacking access to water, let alone clean water, has been exacerbated by COVID-19. At one point, it was common to see empty shelves at the grocery store where many cases of water 
				had once been because people were panicking and buying up all the essentials. This made access to bottled water-scarce for many weeks at the peak of the pandemic.</p>

		<p style = "margin-top: -2%">For many people in the US, they never had access to clean water in the first place. 30% of the population of the Navajo Nation, a United States Indian Reservation which sits on parts of northeastern Arizona,
			southeastern Utah, and northwestern New 
			Mexico, did not have access to clean water before the pandemic. At one point in the pandemic, their infection rates were  <a href = "https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21311211/navajo-nation-covid-19-running-water-access" target = "_blank">higher than that of New York</a>, which shows the impact of lack of clean water--people 
			are unable to wash their hands or shower with water that is not contaminated

				<h3>How Energy Has Been Affected by COVID-19</h3>
				<p>Energy usage and installation of renewable energy has <a href = "https://www.utilitydive.com/news/utilities-are-beginning-to-see-the-load-impacts-of-covid-19-as-economic-sh/574632/" target = "_blank">decreased significantly</a> due to COVID. As businesses and factories shut down, data from NASA satellites show 
				that carbon emissions have dropped drastically, but recent articles have implied that this is nothing to ‚Äúcelebrate.‚Äù They state that as countries slowly start to reopen 
				global carbon emissions will be at its all-time highest. It is very important for us to take the right precautions now and make a switch to renewable energy. 
				During the pandemic, coal demand was down 35 to 45% which forced prices to drop making it <a href = "https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-energy-industry-impact.html" target = "_blank">less profitable</a> but renewable energy was unharmed. Even though renewable 
				energy reached its peak this year, <a href = "https://www.iea.org/articles/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-crisis-on-clean-energy-progress" target = "_blank">IEA stated</a> that it is expected to slow down due to constructions being delayed, supply chain disruptions, lockdown measures, and 
				social distancing regulations. Increased use of renewable energy will <a href = "https://www.iea.org/reports/covid-19-impact-on-electricity" target = "_blank">continue to hurt</a> the profitability of the coal industry until they are forced out of business.</p>
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>	We propose that we use this opportunity to transition to renewable energy and begin shutting down coal power plants. If the industrial industry transitions to full 
				reliance on green energy many other sectors are likely to follow, furthermore carbon emissions would drop a substantial amount, slowing global warming.</p>
